# E-commerce-Event-Driven-Data-Pipeline

Project Overview

This project implements a production-grade, event-driven data pipeline for an e-commerce platform using Databricks and Delta Lake. It ingests and processes data across multiple business domains, enforces robust data quality checks, maintains historical changes, and delivers analytics-ready datasets for business intelligence and reporting.

Built on modern lakehouse architecture principles, the pipeline supports scalable ingestion, advanced validation, data enrichment, and historical tracking through SCD Type 2. It is designed to be scalable, fault-tolerant, and enterprise-ready, leveraging Databricks-native services for orchestration, storage, and monitoring.

The solution follows modern data engineering best practices, including schema enforcement, data validation, SCD Type 2 handling, automated orchestration, and monitoring.
